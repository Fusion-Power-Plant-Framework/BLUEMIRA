# ## BACKGROUND
#
# Geometry matters. It is not plasmsa physics, but it is not trivial.
# It is the source of most errors in BLUEPRINT, because of the number of
# funny edge and corner cases, and because when you parameterise lots of
# different things in very different ways there is a combinatorial explosion of
# geometrical possibilities.
#
# The CAD in BLUEPRINT is not smart. It doesn't know when there are clashes.
# We try to avoid clashes as much as possible in 2-D first.
#
# A bit of background on BLUEPRINT coordinates...
#
# The coordinate system is right-handed and centred at (0, 0, 0).
#
# See e.g. http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Right-HandedCoordinateSystem.html
#
# Or enjoy some of my finest ASCII art instead:
#
# ```
#   z(+) y (+)
#   ^   &
#   |  /
#   |/
#   |-----------> x (+)
# ```
#
# The default plane in BLUEPRINT is the x-z plane.
# The default axis of revolution is the z-axis.
# Rotations are counter-clockwise
# The unit of length is the [metre]. The units in BLUEPRINT are SI (..mostly..)
#
# So, for example, a plasma shape would have a 2-D cross-section specified in m
# on the x-z plane, and rotated about the z-axis to form a torus.

# %%[markdown]
#
# ## INTRODUCTION TO THE LOOP
#
# Problem: we need to store geometry information in a coherent way.
# Solution: the Loop class
#
# *  It is an intelligent collection of coordinates (ordered set of vertices)
# *  With methods to modify the coordinates, or use them in other ways
#
#
# Let's make a triangle:

# %%
triangle = Loop(x=[1, 2, 0], y=[2 ** 0.5, 0, 0])

print(f"triangle.x: {triangle.x}")
print(f"triangle.y: {triangle.y}")

# %%[markdown]
# Good, so these coordinates are the same as specified... Or are they??
#
# *  No.. They have been re-ordered! The Loop is now counter-clockwise
# *  Also, the coordinates are now floats, not integers.
#
#
# These details are important when dealing with various operations, and it is
# important to understand that Loops are by default counter-clockwise (ccw) and
# have underlying numpy arrays of floats for coordinates.
#
# But what about the z-dimension?

# %%
print(f"triangle.z: {triangle.z}")

# %%[markdown]
# It is auto-populated to an array of zeros. This kind of thing is important
# if you care where things are in 3-D.
#
# You can get a quick summary of the Loop by printing it to the console

# %%
print(triangle)

# %%[markdown]
# That doesn't look great.. does it?

# %%
bprint(str(triangle))  # :)

# %%[markdown]
# So let's look at the triangle, and its points

# %%
triangle.plot(points=True)

# %%[markdown]
# The defaults are a red line for open loops, a black line for closed loops, and the
# Loop is filled with a polygon face if it is closed.
# Notice that the triangle is an open Loop as it only has two segments.

# %%
print(f"Is my triangle a closed loop?: {triangle.closed}")

# %%[markdown]
# It is usually desirable to work with closed Loops. These are used frequently
# in BLUEPRINT to describe space reservation of things in 2-D.
#
# Unlike ccw, Loops are not forced to be closed Loops.

# %%
triangle.close()
print(triangle)

# %%[markdown]
# Notice it is now of length = 4, and not 3 as before. The first and end points
# are coincident.
#
# Now, let's plot the triangle again, and make it look a little different

# %%
triangle.plot(edgecolor="k", facecolor="grey")

# %%[markdown]
# Let's see what else this thing can do:

# %%
bprint(
    "Summary of the triangle loop:\n"
    f"|   area: {triangle.area:.2f} m\n"
    f"|   perimeter: {triangle.length:.2f} m\n"
    f"|   centroid: {triangle.centroid}"
)

# %%[markdown]
# ## ACCESSING COORDINATES
#
# The underlying Loop coordinates can be accessed in a variety of ways.
#
# For full coordinate arrays, via access to the xyz attribute

# %%
print(triangle.xyz)

# %%[markdown]
# For full single coordinates, via attribute access or dictionary call

# %%
print(triangle.x)
print(triangle["x"])

# %%[markdown]
# For individual vertices, via indexing and slicing

# %%
print(f"First point in triangle: {triangle[0]}")
print(f"First two points in triangle: {triangle[:2]}")

# %%[markdown]
# Note that when we access single points, we always get the 3 dimensions
# If we only want the "most important" 2 dimensions, then we have to do this:

# %%
print(f"First point x-y: {triangle.d2.T[0]}")
print(f"First two points x-y: {triangle.d2.T[:2]}")

# %%[markdown]
# The d2 attribute accesses the two important coordinates in which the Loop was
# specified. So x-y for x-y Loops and y-z for y-z Loops, etc.

# %%[markdown]
# ## INSTANTIATING A LOOP
#
# There are other ways to instantiate a Loop:
# 1.  from a dictionary
# 2.  from a numpy array
# 3.  from a file

# %%[markdown]
# ### Instantiating a loop from a dictionary

# %%
dictionary = {"x": [1, 2, 3], "y": 4.4573, "z": [0, 0, 2]}

# %%[markdown]
# Notice that if we give a single value to one of the dimensions, the Loop will
# assume that it is on e.g. x-z plane, at an offset of y from the 0-x-z plane.

# %%
dloop = Loop.from_dict(dictionary)

# %%[markdown]
# ### Instantiating a loop from a numpy array

# %%
coordinates = np.array(
    [
        [0, 0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 5, 4, 3, 0],
        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
        [2, 2, 4, 5, 6, 6, 7, 5, 4, 3, 2, 2],
    ]
)

aloop = Loop.from_array(coordinates)

# %%[markdown]
# When plotting Loops, it is also nice sometimes to specify the matplotlib
# Axes object onto which they are plotted.
f, ax = plt.subplots()

aloop.plot(ax)
ax.set_title("aloop from a numpy array")

# %%[markdown]
# ### Instantiating a loop from a file
#
# This is mostly useful for debugging, save Loops if they are nasty geometry
# edge cases, or passing information to people. Loops are saved in a JSON
# format, because it is widely-used and human readable.
#
# First we need to get the folder where some Loops are stored:

# %%
path = get_BP_path("cad/test_data", subfolder="tests")

print(path)

# %%[markdown]
# Then we need to pick a Loop

# %%
name = "plasmaloop.json"
filename = os.sep.join([path, name])

# %%[markdown]
# And instantiate a Loop from it.

# %%
plasma_loop = Loop.from_file(filename)

f, ax = plt.subplots()
plasma_loop.plot(ax, edgecolor="r", facecolor="pink")

# %%[markdown]
# ## TRANSFORMING LOOPS
#
# Obviously, we want to be able to move this stuff around

# %%
f, ax = plt.subplots()
plasma_loop.translate([4, 0, 0])
plasma_loop.plot(ax, edgecolor="r", facecolor="pink")

# %%[markdown]
# The plasma_loop has been permanantly moved. What if we want a copy?

# %%
plasma_loop2 = plasma_loop.translate([4, 0, 0], update=False)

# %%[markdown]
# Now let's rotate it (about the y-axis, clockwise by 30 degrees)

# %%
plasma_loop2.rotate(theta=-30, p1=[0, 0, 0], p2=[0, 1, 0])

# %%
f, ax = plt.subplots()
plasma_loop.plot(ax, edgecolor="b", facecolor="grey")
plasma_loop2.plot(ax, edgecolor="r", facecolor="pink")

# %%[markdown]
# Alright, but what about 3-D? Sure, why not

# %%
loop = plasma_loop.rotate(
    theta=45, p1=[0.1, 0.254, 0.74], p2=[0.4, 0.2, 0.1], update=False
)

loop.plot(facecolor="green")

# %%[markdown]
# ---
# **NOTE**
# matplotlib is not great at 3-D stuff.. some homebrew hacks make this
# work, but if you want to break it you won't have to try very hard.
#
# ---

# %%[markdown]
# ## WORKING WITH LOOPS
#
# There are lots of things we want to do with geometry.. below are some helpful methods

# %%[markdown]
# ### Offsetting

# %%
f, ax = plt.subplots()
plasma_loop.plot(ax)

# %%[markdown]
# Outwards

# %%
f, ax = plt.subplots()
plasma_loop.plot(ax)
for offset_size, color in zip([0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 1], ["r", "orange", "g", "b"]):
    offset_plasma = plasma_loop.offset(offset_size)
    offset_plasma.plot(ax, edgecolor=color, fill=False)

# %%[markdown]
# Inwards

# %%
f, ax = plt.subplots()
plasma_loop.plot(ax)
for offset_size, color in zip([0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 1], ["r", "orange", "g", "b"]):
    offset_plasma = plasma_loop.offset(-offset_size)
    offset_plasma.plot(ax, edgecolor=color, fill=False)

# %%[markdown]
# That last one looks a little funny... welcome to geometry!
# Loops are not yet smart enough to detect that they are self-intersecting..
# Be careful. There are ways of dealing with this, see e.g. below.

# %%
clean_offset = simplify_loop(offset_plasma)

f, ax = plt.subplots()
offset_plasma.plot(ax, facecolor="r")
clean_offset.plot(ax, facecolor="b")
ax.set_xlim([11.64, 11.74])
ax.set_ylim([3.7, 3.76])

# %%[markdown]
# ### Boolean operations
#
# Let's pick up with some fresh plasma loops

# %%
loop1 = Loop.from_file(filename)

loop2 = loop1.translate([4, 0, 0], update=False)

# %%[markdown]
# We can join Loops with boolean union operations

# %%
union = boolean_2d_union(loop1, loop2)[0]
f, ax = plt.subplots()
union.plot(ax, facecolor="b")

# %%[markdown]
# We can subtract loops with boolean difference operations
# We can intersect the loops with boolean common operations
#
# Note that in both the cases there can be multiple answers!
# (in this case there is only one, but we are expecting a list anyway (hence [0])

# %%
diff = boolean_2d_difference(loop1, loop2)[0]

common = boolean_2d_common(loop1, loop2)[0]

f, ax = plt.subplots()
diff.plot(ax, facecolor="r")
common.plot(ax, facecolor="b")

# %%[markdown]
# OK, enough about Loops.

# %%[markdown]
# ## INTRODUCTION TO THE SHELL
#
# In BLUEPRINT, a Shell is Loop within a Loop. It is a subset of the Polygon
# with holes problem.
#
# Let's make one
# We have to specify an inner Loop and an outer Loop
# It's not super-smart, so if you want to break it, again, you can.

# %%
shell = Shell(clean_offset, plasma_loop)

# %%[markdown]
# Shells work in much the same way as Loops

# %%
f, ax = plt.subplots()
shell.plot(ax, linewidth=8, edgecolor="k", facecolor="orange")

# %%[markdown]
# ---
# **NOTE**
# matplotlib kwargs will usually work.. usually
#
# ---
#
# WE can transform them too

# %%
rotated_shell = shell.rotate(
    theta=234, p1=[0, 23, 5], p2=[23.5, 423, np.pi], update=False
)

rotated_shell.plot(edgecolor="k", facecolor="b")
