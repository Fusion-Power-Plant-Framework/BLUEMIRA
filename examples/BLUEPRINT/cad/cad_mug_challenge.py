# If you've completed the previous tutorial and played around a little making freeform
# shapes, consider this challenge: modelling a CAD mug.
# A basic mug with handle can be made in CAD using the same tools covered in the tutorial
# , namely:
# ```
# make_circle()
# extrude()
# make_axis()
# revolve()
# booleon_fuse()
# boolean_cut()
# ```
# In other words, a simple mug can be created by correctly building the same cylinders
# and tori from tokamak CAD. Try to make a mug in the box below using the CAD functions
# above.
#
# # MAKE A MUG

# This line will create a 2D circular base for your mug.
# You can use this as a starting point or delete the line to start from scratch.

# # WRITE A CAD FUNCTION
#
# Generally, it's good practice to functionise your code. That way, it's easy to create a
# similar object later by varying the function inputs, rather than writing out the same
# thing again. But what are the key parameters of a mug?
#
# Below is an example of function to create a CAD mug with parameters set by keyword
# arguements. For a circular mug, the radius of the base is the key parameter, along with
# height. The thickness of the mug is also set here as a fraction of radius and height.
# However, the mug handle is hard coded in shape relative to the mug radius and height.
#
# See if you can modify the code below to add parameters allowing customisation of the
# handle.
