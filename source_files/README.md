# bluemira-2d-neutronics-testing

This runs an OpenMC simulation for to calculate neutronics results for different fusion reactor designs in a few seconds. 

The following parameters are calculated:
* TBR, 
* Component heating, 
* First wall neutron damage and heat flux.


### Prerequisites

An installation of OpenMC version 0.13.0 or later is required. See https://docs.openmc.org/en/stable/quickinstall.html.
