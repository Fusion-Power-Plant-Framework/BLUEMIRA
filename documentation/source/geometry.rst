geometry

Background
----------

Geometry matters. It may not be plasmsa physics, but it is not trivial. 

The CAD in bluemira is not smart. It doesn't know when there are clashes. We try to avoid clashes as much as possible in 2-D first.

The coordinate system is right-handed, Cartesian (x, y, z) and centred at (0, 0, 0): shown in black below.

* The default plane in bluemira is the x-z plane.
* The default axis of revolution is the z-axis.
* Rotations are counter-clockwise (positive) and clockwise (negative)
* The unit of length is the [metre]. The units in bluemira are SI (..mostly..)
