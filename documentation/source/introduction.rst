Introduction
============

``Bluemira`` is a Python 3 framework for designing tokamak nuclear fusion reactors. It
has been developed from the original ``BLUEPRINT`` code, written by M. Coleman and 
S. McIntosh, and the ``MIRA`` code, written by F. Franza.

The overarching aim of the ``bluemira`` framework is to facilitate reactor design using 
different levels of fidelity at different stages in the design process. The general i
is that there is nothing particularly wrong with how tokamak fusion reactors are designed
today, except that it takes months to reach an initial design point. In ``bluemira``,
typical tokamak fusion reactor design activities are parameterised, automated, combined
together, and exposed to the user, enabling reactor designs to be generated in a matter 
of minutes.
