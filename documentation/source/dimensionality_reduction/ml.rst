Machine Learning in Bluemira
============================

The aim of this module is to provide a simple interface to many machine learning tools in order to facilitate the production of new simplified models of phenomena.
Machine Learning more or less boils down to reducing the dimensionality of input data as explored `here <https://github.com/latinxinai/AI-Educational-Resources/blob/master/CheatSheets/Machine%20Learning%20Cheat%20Sheet.pdf>`_.

Each of these tools can be combined into a machine learning pipeline producing as an output a model that can be used to predict the dynamics of a given phenomena.
