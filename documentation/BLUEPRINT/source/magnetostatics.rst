magnetostatics
==============

A set of analytical and semi-analytical calculation tools to evaulate magnetic field and flux due to arbitrary current sources.


This module was written by Matti Coleman, but is based heavily on the
works of:

- Simon McIntosh, UKAEA/ITER Organisation, United Kingdom: Whoâ€™s Nova code (private repo) provided much of the inspiration behind the Biot-Savart solver.

- Zhang and Koh, An Efficient Semianalytic Computation Method of Magnetic Field for a Circular Coil With Rectangular Cross Section, 2011, https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6019053

- Feng, The  Treatment of Singularities in Calculation of Magnetic Field by Using Integral Method, 1985, https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1064259
