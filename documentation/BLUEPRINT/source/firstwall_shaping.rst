First wall profile procedure
============================

This document refers to the ``FirstWall`` class in ``firstwall.py``.  

Overview
--------
Provided a plasma equilibrium, the FirstWall class allows to design 
a first wall profile and optimise it, in order to reduce the heat flux values 
within prescribed limits. 
Currently, the first wall profile can be made either for the SN or the DN configuration.

The procedure is analogous for the SN configuration and the DN configuration.
For the DN configuration all reasoning are essentially doubled as, in the ideal and 
unlikely scenario, there is no charged particle flow between Low Field Side (LFS) 
and High Field Side (HFS), thus the power coming from the Outboard Mid-Plane (OMP) 
is responsible for the heat flux on the outer wall, hence its optimisation, 
and the power coming from the Inboard Mid-Plane (IMP) is responsible for the heat flux
on the inner wall, hence its optimisation.

Input
-----
- Equilibrium (e.g. .eqdsk, .geqdsk)
- Type of plasma (e.g. SN, DN)
- First wall geometrical offset, :math:`Delta_{fw}` 
  (Starting offset between plasma and wall. Either a single value 
  or two different values for inboard and outboard)
- Scrape-off layer power decay length, :math:`lambda_{q,nearSOL}` and 
  :math:`lambda_{q,farSOL}` (Either a single couple of valuesor two for inboard and outboard)
- Power crossing the SOL, :math:`P_{SOL,near}` and :math:`P_{SOL,far}`
  (Either a single couple of valuesor two for inboard and outboard)
- Hypothetical power sharing among targets

Output
------
- Heat flux onto the first wall

Procedure
---------
- Load equilibrium file
- Extract key attributes:
  - Last Closed Flux Surface (LCFS)
  - O-point coordinates
  - X-point(s) coordinates
  - Separatrix 
  
The preliminary first wall profile is drawn following some objects referred in the script 
as "guidelines". This guidelines are the flux lines chosen by the designer, according to 
the input :math:`Delta_{fw}` . Either the same offset or two different offset values can be
used at the inboard and outboard.
- SN: Offset the LCFS by :math:`Delta_{fw}` .
- DN: Get the flux lines passing through the points lying on the mid-plane (IMP and OMP), 
  and offsetted by :math:`Delta_{fw}` from the LCFS.
- Cut the obtained flux line(s) below the X-point and/or above the upper X-point

- Make flux surfaces


The heat flux along the field lines in the SOL is usually assumed to decay 
exponentially with the distance from the LCFS at the OMP, :math:`r_u`:

.. math::
   
   q_{\parallel}(r_u) = q_{\parallel,0}e^{-r_u/\lambda_q}
   
Where :math:`q_{\parallel,0}` is the flux at the separatrix, and :math:`\lambda_q` 
is the heatflux decay length in the SOL.

To be more precise, the SOL exhibits two different regions [Nespoli_2017]_:

- A ‚Äúnear‚Äù SOL, extending a few mm from the LCFS, characterized by a steep profile of :math:`q_{\parallel}`
  and responsible for the peak heat loads in the divertor region;
- A ‚Äúfar‚Äù SOL, typically some cm wide, with a flatter profile of :math:`q_{\parallel}`
  and responsible for most of the heat deposited onto the first wall.

   Parallel heat flux radial profile in JET.

The parallel heat flux radial profile :math:`q_{\parallel}` is then better described by a sum of two 
exponentials, associated with the two different regions:

.. math::
   
   q_{\parallel}(r_u) = q_{n}e^{-r_u/\lambda_n} + q_{f}e^{-r_u/\lambda_f}

Where :math:`\lambda_n` and :math:`\lambda_f` are the near and far SOL decay lengths and :math:`q_n` and :math:`q_f` 
are the associated heat flux magnitudes.

According to the above expression, the code calculates the radial profile of the 
poloidal component of the heat flux at the OMP, assuming :math:`P_{SOL}` distributed 
between near and far scrape off layer:

.. math::
   
   q_{p,u}(r_u) = \dfrac{P_{SOL,n}e^{-r_u/\lambda_n}}{2 \pi R(r_u)\lambda_n} + \dfrac{P_{SOL,f}e^{-r_u/\lambda_f}}{2 \pi R(r_u)\lambda_f}

At the OMP, the heat flux parallel to the magnetic field :math:`q_{\parallel,u}` and that parallel to 
the poloidal component of the field :math:`q_{p,u}` are related by :math:`q_{\parallel,u} = q_{p,u}(B_{tot,u}/B_{p,u)}`.

To compute the heat flux at the target location, one must consider that each poloidal 
flux surface has a ‚Äúwidth‚Äù, evaluated at the outboard mid-plane and indicated here as :math:`dr_u` [Maurizio_2020]_.

.. figure:: ../images/nova/flux_expansion.png

   Description of the SOL scalar coordinate :math:`dr_{u}` , defined at the outboard mid-plane, 
   and its relation to the SOL scalar coordinate dx, defined at the divertor target.


Such flux surface width varies when moving poloidally around the confined plasma or along 
the divertor leg. The ratio of the width at the target and at the OMP
is called target poloidal flux expansion.

.. math::
   
   f_{x,t} = \dfrac{dr_t}{dr_u} = \dfrac{R_{u}B_{p,u}}{R_{t}B_{p,t}}

Where :math:`R_u` and :math:`B_{p,u}` are major radius and poloidal magnetic field at the outboard midplane, 
and :math:`R_t` and :math:`B_{p,t}` are major radius and poloidal magnetic field at the target.

Since the power entering a flux tube at the OMP location is equal to the power that exits 
the same flux tube at the target, :math:`2\pi R_{u} dr_{u} q_{p,u} = 2\pi R_{t} dr_{u} f_{x,t} q_{p,t}` 
the poloidal heat flux component at the target can be calculated as:

.. math::

   q_{p,t} = q_{p,u}\frac{R_u}{R_t}\frac{1}{f_{x,t}}

From the poloidal component, at the target, the perpendicular heat flux component is calculated 
considering the angle between flux surface and target surface:

.. math::

   q_{\perp,ùë°} = q_{p,t}sin\beta_t
