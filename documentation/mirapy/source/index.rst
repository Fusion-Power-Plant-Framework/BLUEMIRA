.. warning::

    This is the documentation of **MIRApy**, the python implementation of MIRA.
    MIRA has been developed in MATLAB and its python "conversion" is still
    at a preliminary stage.
    
    The actual package implements:
        * geometrical class
        * meshing class with gmsh
        * fem interface through fenics/dolfin
        * electromagnetic class (Biot-Savart and Green's function)
        * Grad-Schafranov fixed boundary plasma solution
    
    Still not completed:
        * equilibrium solver: missing implementation of a complete set of constraints (update class equilibrium.py)
        * TF/PF coils optimization:
            * conversion to the new architecture of PF_TF_optimization_procedure.py
        * 3D shape:
            * conversion of old Test3D.py
    
    Not implemented:
        - full pulse implementation    
        - material implementation
        - neutronic class
        - Power cycle
        - ...

.. note::
    Check the code according to PEP8 rules
