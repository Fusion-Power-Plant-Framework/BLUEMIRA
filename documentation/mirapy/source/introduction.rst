MIRA (Multiphysics Approach to Designing a Fusion Power Plant) [Franza]_ 
is a high spatial resolution design tool developed at KIT, 
incorporating the physics and the engineering insights of the utmost 
domains of tokamak reactors. MIRA relies on a modular
structure and provides an FPP baseline. It closely incorporates into a unique
computing environment (see Figure 2) a mathematical algorithm for the
following problems:

* 2D radial/vertical geometry and material characterization of physical
  components, i.e. plasma, breeding blanket (BB), vacuum vessel (VV) and
  toroidal field (TF) and poloidal field (PF) coils;
* 2D free-boundary plasma magnetic equilibrium;
* constrained gradient-based PF coil solver, incorporating plasma shaping
  requirements and coils engineering constraints for all plasma operational
  phases, i.e. breakdown, the start of flat-top (SOF) and the end of
  flat-top (EOF);
* plasma and divertor physics modules based on one-dimensional ion,
  electron and impurity transport [5];
* quasi 2D neutron and photon core radiation transport for the evaluation
  of breeding (TBR), heating and shielding capabilities of all in-vessel
  reactor components;
* 3D magneto-static modeling of TF and PF coils elements and engineering
  characterization of superconducting cables;

Compared to presently available system codes, MIRA is based on a higher 
mathematical sophistication, engaging systems analyses up to 
three-dimensional space resolution. This allows scoping multiple 
reactor configurations with a more consolidated modeling granularity 
at a component level and with a holistic view of the entire plant, 
thereby leaving room for design modifications to a higher degree.

The MIRA approach has been applied to the DEMO baselines 2015 [Process]_
and 2017,  generated by the PROCESS code. The analyses have been carried 
out by taking an identical set of input assumptions and requirements (e.g. 
same fusion  power, major radius, and aspect ratio) and observing the response 
on the key design targets and the imposed operational limits. Based on more 
accurate MIRA analysis, both baselines have been found in conflict with 
some of these limits, in particular on plasma burn time (33 % below the 
two-hour goal) and maximum TF ripple on the plasma boundary (13 % above 
its upper limit). The major causes for these discrepancies between PROCESS
and MIRA are attributed to the reduced spatial resolution, to the modeling 
simplifications and limited engineering capabilities of PROCESS.
In PROCESS, the burn time is based on simple 0D magnetic flux conservation 
and peak magnetic field in the central solenoid (CS), whilst the TF ripple 
is calculated from predefined scaling laws. In MIRA, instead, the burn time 
derives from the 2D calculation of poloidal flux profiles
:math:`\Psi(r,z)` at SOF and 
EOF magnetic equilibrium configurations (see Figure 3) with plasma shaping 
requirements (:math:`\partial D_p^t` target shape) and coil technological limits. 
The TF ripple is computed via 3D magneto-static analysis.
