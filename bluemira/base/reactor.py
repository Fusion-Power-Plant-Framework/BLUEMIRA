class Reactor:
    """
    Base class for reactor definitions.

    Assign :obj:`bluemira.base.builder.ComponentManager` instances to
    fields defined on the reactor, and this class acts as a container
    to group those components' trees. It is also a place to define any
    methods to calculate/derive properties that require information
    about multiple reactor components.

    Components should be defined on the reactor as class properties
    annotated with a type (similar to a ``dataclass``). A type that
    subclasses ``ComponentManager`` must be given, or it will not be
    recognised as part of the reactor tree. Note that a declared
    component is not required to be set for the reactor to be valid.
    So it is possible to just add a reactor's plasma, but not its
    TF coils, for example.

    Parameters
    ----------
    name: str
        The name of the reactor. This will be the label for the top
        level :obj:`bluemira.base.components.Component` in the reactor
        tree.

    Example
    -------

    .. code-block:: python

        class MyReactor(Reactor):
            '''An example of how to declare a reactor structure.'''

            plasma: MyPlasma
            tf_coils: MyTfCoils

            def get_ripple(self):
                '''Calculate the ripple in the TF coils.'''

        reactor = MyReactor("My Reactor")
        reactor.plasma = build_plasma()
        reactor.tf_coils = build_tf_coils()
        reactor.show_cad()
